Team Alpha - AI Guard

AI Guard is a project aimed towards making AI usage in online content fully transparent, and giving users a choice on its consumption. It aids users in identifying AI generated media across many platforms, helping to keep them informed about the credibility and authenticity of what they're seeing. It detects AI-generated content on social media, flags AI-produced videos, and analyzes articles or entire websites to indicate when content is likely machine-generated.
